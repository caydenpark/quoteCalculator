# Overview

This program was purely a learning experience for me. I challenged myself to lean the Swift programming language. I quickly learned that it wouldn't be a huge challenge as I already know the Python which I consider do be a very simliar language syntactically.

This program is a quote calculator for washing windows. It could very well be a template for any number of companies who give quotes to customers. I myself have a window washing business that I do in the summers and thought this could be a useful program for myself and more importantly, for my potential clients and customers.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Swift to develop this software in Xcode.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- More functionality. Save quotes to a .txt file
- More options to user. Maybe options for if they need other things cleaned, blinds, tracks, sills, screens, etc.
