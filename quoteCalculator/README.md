# Overview

This program was purely a learning experience for me. I challenged myself to lean the Swift programming language. I quickly learned that it wouldn't be a huge challenge as I already know the Python which I consider do be a very simliar language syntactically.

This program is a quote calculator for washing windows. It could very well be a template for any number of companies who give quotes to customers. I myself have a window washing business that I do in the summers and thought this could be a useful program for myself and more importantly, for my potential clients and customers.

# Development Environment

I used Swift to develop this software in Xcode.

# Future Work

- More functionality. Save quotes to a .txt file
- More options to user. Maybe options for if they need other things cleaned, blinds, tracks, sills, screens, etc.
